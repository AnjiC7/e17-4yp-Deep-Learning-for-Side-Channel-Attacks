## Introduction
Side-channel attacks (SCAs) pose a significant threat to the security of cryptographic systems, as they exploit unintended information leakage through side channels such as power consumption, timing variations, or electromagnetic radiation. These attacks aim to extract sensitive information, like secret keys, by analyzing the physical implementations (as mentioned above) of a cryptographic device rather than directly breaking the algorithm.<br>
In recent years, deep learning (DL) techniques have gained considerable attention and success in various fields, and domains. When we speak about Deep Learning algorithms, we have Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Deep neural networks (DNNs), Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) etc. Each algorithm has its own strengths and applications. The choice of algorithm depends on the nature of the problem or issue and the characteristics of the data. But most of the cases have been captured by Deep neural networks (DNNs) and
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Both algorithms have shown remarkable capabilities in capturing complex patterns and extracting meaningful features from high-dimensional data. When we went through related researches or publications Convolutional Neural Networks has played a major role.<br>
Deep Learning based SCA attacks leverage the power of neural networks to learn the complex relationship between the observed side-channel leakage and the underlying secret key even without knowing the algorithm. By training DL models on large amount of datasets of side-channel measurements or traces, these attacks can enhance the efficiency and accuracy of information extraction, even in the presence of countermeasures.To train DL models, it requires substantial amounts of labeled training data, which may be costly or time-consuming to obtain.But, currently its not a big issue since some research in this field have already addressed these issues.<br>
This field, Deep Learning based SCA attacks is rapidly evolving, and numerous research papers have been published.These papers explore various aspects, including the design and architecture of DL models, the impact of different network configurations on attack performance, and the effectiveness of DL-based attacks against different cryptographic devices and countermeasures.<br>
We expect to test RFTC against ASCAD, AISY and SCAAML frmework, improve MLP andd CNN models to attack RFTC and also attack other block cipher circuit (PRESENT, Simon, Speck etc ...) using the developed CNN or MLP models.
