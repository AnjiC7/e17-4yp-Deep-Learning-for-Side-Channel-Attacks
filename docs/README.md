## Abstract
Side-channel attacks (SCAs) pose a significant threat to the 
security of cryptographic systems, as they exploit unintended 
information leakage through side channels such as power 
consumption, timing variations, or electromagnetic radiation. 
These attacks aim to extract sensitive information, like secret 
keys, by analyzing the physical implementations (as mentioned 
above) of a cryptographic device rather than directly breaking 
the algorithm.
In recent years, deep learning (DL) techniques have gained 
considerable attention and success in various fields, and do- 
mains. When we speak about Deep Learning algorithms, 
we have Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short- 
Term Memory (LSTM), Generative Adversarial Networks 
(GANs), Reinforcement Learning (RL), Deep neural networks 
(DNNs), Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), etc. Each 
algorithm has its strengths and applications. The choice of 
algorithm depends on the nature of the problem or issue 
and the characteristics of the data. But most of the cases 
have been captured by Deep neural networks (DNNs) and 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Both algorithms have 
shown remarkable capabilities in capturing complex patterns 
and extracting meaningful features from high-dimensional 
data. When we went through related research or publications 
Convolutional Neural Networks has played a major role.
Deep Learning based SCA attacks leverages the power of 
neural networks to learn the complex relationship between 
the observed side-channel leakage and the underlying secret 
key even without knowing the algorithm. By training DL 
models on a large number of datasets of side-channel mea- 
surements or traces, these attacks can enhance the efficiency
and accuracy of information extraction, even in the presence 
of countermeasures. Training DL models requires substantial 
amounts of labeled training data, which may be costly or time- 
consuming to obtain. But, currently, itâ€™s not a big issue since 
some research in this field has already addressed these issues.
This field, Deep Learning based SCA attacks is rapidly 
evolving, and numerous research papers have been published. 
These papers explore various aspects, including the design and 
architecture of DL models, the impact of different network 
configurations on attack performance, and the effectiveness of 
DL-based attacks against different cryptographic devices and 
countermeasures
